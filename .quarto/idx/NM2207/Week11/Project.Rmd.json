There is a lack of universally accepted moral standards on the death penalty: proponents advocate for its role in upholding moral duty and legal principles, while opponents assert it violates the salinity of life (Pojman & Reiman, 1998).

The significance of deterrence in cultures with and without the death penalty are very different. Jurisdictions like Southern American state Tennessee employs 'death row' not only to signify the gravity of investigations but also to serve as a deterrent, sometimes without performing actual executions (Wright, 1991).

Looking at Western data on death penalty is interesting in terms of how in the ideological conflict, they would usually accuse the Eastern culture as 'uncivilized' and 'morally impermissible' that the latter would still execute people (Feng, 2007).
